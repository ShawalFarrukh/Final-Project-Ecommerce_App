  <p class="text-muted">My story with dry eye</p>
  <p>
    Hi I’m Shawal Farrukh and I’ve been dealing with dry eye for years now. This small shop is a CS50 project
    inspired by what actually helped me day-to-day to manage my disease: warm compresses, preservative-free drops, lid hygiene,
    and lifestyle tweaks. I’m not a doctor; I just wanted a simple place to collect and share the basics.
  </p>

    I hope these tools help you build a routine. If you’re struggling, check the Support page for communities
    and resources that helped me.
